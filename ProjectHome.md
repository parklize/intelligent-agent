A field of decision science, the model management society, has made a great effort to represent constraints in an abstract level and to associate it with data models such as databases. What they ultimately hope to achieve is to allow human beings, regardless of what software and hardware platforms they are using, to manage and manipulate various mathematical decision models in a more abstract and seamless manner than before. The same thing is required currently in the Semantic Web.

Semantic Web Constraint Language (SWCL) based on OWL to combine constraints with an OWL knowledge base in an abstract level. Abstract syntax of SWCL to facilitate access to constraints and the evaluation of their expressions in the Semantic Web. The syntax for SWCL extends the abstract syntax of OWL described in the OWL Semantics and Abstract Syntax document with additional axioms for constraints used in SWRL. An abstract syntax for SWCL is specified using a version of the EBNF notation used for XML Terminals are quoted, whereas non-terminals are bold but not quoted.
